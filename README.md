# AFK AI website

Public landing page and download route for [AFK AI for Windows](https://github.com/allusionsafk/localai-windows-starter).

**Live site:** https://localai-windows-starter-site.allusionsafk.workers.dev/

[Product](PRODUCT.md) | [Design](DESIGN.md) | [Support](SUPPORT.md) | [Security](SECURITY.md) | [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

The site uses static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript plus one Cloudflare Worker route for the pinned Friend Beta installer.

## Public behaviour

| Surface | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Homepage | Static. No accounts, forms, or analytics |
| Download route | `/download` |
| Pinned candidate | Friend Beta `0.1.7rc1` |
| Integrity | SHA-256 checked before installer bytes are returned |
| Failure mode | Refuse the download on upstream or hash mismatch |
| Version authority | Website pin, not `releases/latest` |

The repository also serves an Adaptive Media page under `/adaptive-media/`. It does not control the AFK AI download route.

## Structure

```text
public/
  index.html
  adaptive-media/index.html
  assets/
  .well-known/security.txt
  _headers
  robots.txt

worker.js
wrangler.toml
tests/
```

Repository documentation and development files outside `public/` are not deployed as site content.

## Local development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
```

`npm run dev` starts Wrangler with the Worker route. A plain static server can preview the page, but `/download` will not work and the site does not fall back to an unpinned installer.

## Deployment

Deploy with:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

A repository commit does not prove that the live Cloudflare deployment changed. Verify the deployed site separately.

## Download integrity

For `GET` or `HEAD` requests to `/download`, `worker.js`:

1. fetches the installer from the exact pinned tag
2. computes SHA-256 over the returned bytes
3. compares it with the committed digest
4. serves the file only on an exact match
5. refuses the request if retrieval or verification fails

The browser does not select a release dynamically.

## Security and privacy

The site has no accounts, cookies, forms, database, or analytics. Fonts and page assets are self-hosted. The deployed headers include a restrictive Content Security Policy and standard browser security controls.

AFK AI itself is local-first, not offline-only. Local inference and chat storage can remain on the user's machine. Setup, model downloads, updates, optional web search, and online integrations can use the internet.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting and [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for issue routing.
